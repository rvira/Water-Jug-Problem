# Water-Jug-Problem
The most popular Artificial Intelligence problem, the Water Jug poblem. There are two jugs of volume A litre and B litre. Neither has any measuring mark on it. There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water. How can you get exactly x litre of water into the A litre jug. Assuming that we have unlimited supply of water.


## Problem statement: 
IMPLEMENT WATER JUG PROBLEM USING UN INFORMED SEARCH STRATEGY. 
1. Formulate the problem precisely, making only those distinctions necessary to ensure a valid solution. Draw a diagram of the PARTIAL state space. 
2. Implement and solve the problem using an Uninformed search strategy: BFS and DFS 
3. Compare both search strategies against evaluation criteria 
  - Completeness 
  - Optimal 
  - Time complexity 
  - Space Complexity
